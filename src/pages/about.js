          The Election Commission (EC) at IIT Kanpur was established to ensure the
          democratic spirit and fairness in the election processes within the
          Students' Gymkhana. The Students' Gymkhana, founded in 1962, serves as the
          student government organization aimed at cultivating leadership qualities
          and promoting the general welfare of the student body. The primary role of
          the EC is to conduct free and fair elections, adhering to the norms and
          Model Code of Conduct of the Students' Gymkhana.

          Our vision is to cultivate a robust and engaged student community where
          every individual's voice is heard and valued through the power of their
          vote. We envision a campus where high voter turnout reflects a united and
          proactive student body, capable of influencing university decisions and
          policies effectively. By fostering a culture of democratic participation,
          we aim to develop future leaders who understand the significance of
          governance and are dedicated to advocating for the interests and
          well-being of their peers.
